# jmdstack

short for jammed stack ðŸ¤ª

## what
- all different tech stack will be added here together
- it is **not** a project trying to be useful by any means

## why
- ðŸ˜‰ just for fun
- oh and it should allow me to learn old and new tech at least for basics

## roadmap
- the list can grow anytime I feel like it
- and I'm probably being quite ambitious about the listing
- it's ok, it's more like a wishlist
- I don't expect to finish this anyway
- orders are kind of from more likely to less likely but who knows
